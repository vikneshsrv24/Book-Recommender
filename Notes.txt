We can use API or large book dataset for the project.
Popular API includes :
 * ISBNdb - Cost [https://isbndb.com/isbn-database]
 * Google Books - Free [https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using]
 * Open Library - Free [https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books]

Here we are using goodreads dataset.
 1- First dataset contains user_id - each user of goodreads.
 2- Book_id each id for books in the datasets.
 3- Ratings of each books

 Next dataset we have book metadata which contains
 informations like series, country code, lang code,
 description,genre,publication year etc.

 Third dataset includes book_id because it helps us
 in connecting the same book from first dataset

Three main steps in our projects are 
   1 - Search for Books
   2 - Create Book Lists
   3 - Recommend Books

1 - We will also going to build a search engine for \
searching books
